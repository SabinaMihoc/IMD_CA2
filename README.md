About the project

This project is a digital version of my CV and all the details included are accurate.

This project was create using HTML 5, Bootstrap 5, Css and JavaScript.

For the pallet colour I choosed black, green and lots of with space. A sticky nav bar was added so the user can see all the sections availabe and quiqly navigate to the desired section without having to scrol. The designed is simple and easy to use, initially showing only the main information and if the user wishes to see more details they can drill down. The website include links to my social profiles and github. All the links are opening in a new tab. Also the user can download my CV and certs. A contact form is available but the informtion entered is not being processed. If the users submits the form they will see an alert informing them the form is not working.
